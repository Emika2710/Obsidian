# Overview

## Introduction:

14 Million Europeans are currently suffer from dementia. It is an umbrella term for a great number of symptoms related to the loss of cognitive abilities. The disease leads to varied impairments in the quality of life of both the patient and the people around them.

Supporting people with dementia - that was the theme of a project during my studies. In a team of three we developed a concept for a product in that area.

## Our solution:

Retrace is a three part tracking system both accessible for older people and highly customizable for the caregivers around them.

## 1. Empathize with user

Starting this project, none of us had a good grasp of dementia. To learn more we took a three step approach consulting different sources to understand the reality of people with and around dementia.

### Research (papers - statistics - literature)

Firstly, we took to literature to learn about the fundamentals surrounding dementia. There is a plethora of organisations trying to educate people about the disease, often telling differing and sometimes confliction information.

As I mentioned bevor, dementia is an umbrella term for many diseases, all with different causes, symptoms and effects. We tried to focus our efforts on Alzheimer's disease, the most common cause for dementia with 60% to 80% of all cases.

-> Statistics

### Interviews (relatives - caregiver)

With our acquired knowledge we took to talking with real people around dementia.

One is a nurse working in a retirement home. According to her, most seniors living there have some stage of dementia. She described a range of effects dementia can have on people and how caregivers learn to adapt to their patients wants and needs. We would go on and consult her again in different stages of this project.

Other people were relatives of dementia patient. They described the everyday struggle and mental strain connected to having a relative with dementia.

These stories helped humanize these people and gave ample inspiration for Retrace.

-> " [Sie] sitzen vor der geschmierten Schnitte, wissen aber nicht wie sie das Ding in den Mund nehmen soll." (About eating: "[They] sit in front of a prepared sandwich and don't know how to put it into their mouth.")

### Expert opinion

The finishing touch to our research was a presentation by a representative of the "Alzheimer Gesellschaft Ingolstadt", Ms. Stampfer. She confirmed many facts we read and heard about bevor, but also gave insights into ways to deal with dementia as a caregiver and relative. We learned best practices and common pitfalls we later implemented into the final product.

Key insights

1. Diversity: There is no such thing a typical dementia patient. Symptoms and progression vary greatly from patient to patient.
2. Shame: Many patients with early stage dementia are ashamed of their condition and try to hide their struggles.
3. Strain: Dementia puts a strain on not just the patient, but also their relatives and their relationships. They should also be considered.
4. Technologie: People with dementia and their imitate surroundings are often not very good with newer technology.

## 2. Define Requirements

### Concept

Using our research we developed multiple concepts we could peruse going forward. We decided on a tracking system for three key reasons:

1. Not just digital, not just physical:
	- Retrace has both a physical and digital interface. The module itself focused on digital application but according to our research, physical interfaces would be more accessible to older people for a variety of reasons.
2. Uncommon concept
	- Our course had over 20 teams working on the central theme of supporting people with dementia. Some ideas are bound to be similar. We contiously choose a concept that was out of the ordinary to not (unintentionally) copy ideas or spark any form of competition.
3. United Vision:
	- As a group we need a united understanding of our central concept, its use cases and strengths. Most of that comes down to feeling. It was clear early on that we were most passionate about Retrace out of all our ideas.

### Business Problem
We found out that people with dementia often misplace items. Connected to that is the tendency in some patients to hide important or trivial items from those around them. We want to expand on existing tracking systems in multiple ways. The first is by making the trackers work like pagers when activated, aiding in the search of nearby items. The second is giving dementia patients a physical interface through haptic buttons, since their often struggle with digital mediums.
### Personas
We created a total of 6 personas to better understand the wants and needs of different users. Using their perspective we gathered our initial requirements for Retrace.

## 3. Ideate key requirements

User Journeys

1. Having an overview of all items connected to a Retrace system
2. A way to activate a tracker through the app
3. Having GPS-location of all trackers in the app
4. Being able to change the type of signal of a tracker to the needs of a patient
5. Customizing the location of items/ trackers on the physical board through the app
6. Connecting a new item/ tracker or patient (only for institutions)
