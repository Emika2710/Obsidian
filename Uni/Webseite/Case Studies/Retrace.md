# Overview

## Introduction:

14 Million Europeans are currently suffer from dementia. It is an umbrella term for a great number of symptoms related to the loss of cognitive abilities. The disease leads to varied impairments in the quality of life of both the patient and the people around them.

Supporting people with dementia - that was the theme of a project during my studies. In a team of three we developed a concept for a product in that area.
## Our solution:

Retrace is a three part tracking system both accessible for older people and highly customizable for the caregivers around them.

## 1. Empathize with user

Starting this project, none of us had a good grasp of dementia. To learn more we took a three step approach consulting different sources to understand the reality of people with and around dementia.

### Research (papers - statistics - literature)

Firstly, we took to literature to learn about the fundamentals surrounding dementia. There is a plethora of organisations trying to educate people about the disease, often telling differing and sometimes confliction information.
-> Statistics

### Interviews (relatives - caregiver)

With our acquired knowledge we took to talking with real people around dementia.

One is a nurse working in a retirement home. According to her, most seniors living there have some stage of dementia. She described a range of effects dementia can have on people and how caregivers learn to adapt to their patients wants and needs. We would go on and consult her again in different stages of this project.

Other people were relatives of dementia patient. They described the everyday struggle and mental strain connected to having a relative with dementia.

-> " [Sie] sitzen vor der geschmierten Schnitte, wissen aber nicht wie sie das Ding in den Mund nehmen soll." (About eating: "[They] sit in front of a prepared sandwich and don't know how to put it into their mouth.")

### Expert opinion

The finishing touch to our research was a presentation by a representative of the "Alzheimer Gesellschaft Ingolstadt", Ms. Stampfer. She confirmed many facts we read and heard about bevor, but also gave insights into ways to deal with dementia as a caregiver and relative. 
## Key insights

1. **Diversity:** There is no such thing a typical dementia patient. Symptoms and progression vary greatly from patient to patient.
2. **Shame:** Many patients with early stage dementia are ashamed of their condition and try to hide their struggles.
3. **Strain:** Dementia puts a strain on not just the patient, but also their relatives and their relationships. They should also be considered.
4. **Technologie:** People with dementia and their imitate surroundings are often not very good with newer technology.

## 2. Define Requirements

### Concept

Using our research we developed multiple concepts we could peruse going forward. We decided on a tracking system for three key reasons:

1. Not just digital, not just physical:
	- Retrace has both a physical and digital interface. The module itself focused on digital application but according to our research, physical interfaces would be more accessible to older people for a variety of reasons.
2. Uncommon concept
	- Our course had over 20 teams working on the central theme of supporting people with dementia. Some ideas are bound to be similar. We contiously choose a concept that was out of the ordinary to not (unintentionally) copy ideas or spark any form of competition.
3. United Vision:
	- As a group we need a united understanding of our central concept, its use cases and strengths. Most of that comes down to feeling. It was clear early on that we were most passionate about Retrace out of all our ideas.

### Business Problem
We found out that people with dementia often misplace items. Connected to that is the tendency in some patients to hide important or trivial items from those around them. We want to expand on existing tracking systems in multiple ways. The first is by making the trackers work like pagers when activated, aiding in the search of nearby items. The second is giving dementia patients a physical interface through haptic buttons, since their often struggle with digital mediums.
### Personas
We created a total of 6 personas to better understand the wants and needs of different users. Using their perspective we gathered our initial requirements for Retrace.

## 3. Ideate on our app
We created two User Journeys for our two primary users: a patient and a nurse.

~User Journeys~

Using our User Journeys we collected Key Requirements Retrace needed to cover:
1. Having an overview of all items connected to a Retrace system
2. A way to activate a tracker through the app
3. Having GPS-location of all trackers in the app
4. Being able to change the type of signal of a tracker to the needs of a patient
5. Customizing the location of items/ trackers on the physical board through the app
6. Connecting a new item/ tracker or patient (only for institutions)

With our list of features we created two Wireframe systems, one for privat users, one for institutions. The main difference is that institutions need to track multiple patients, each with their own system of items. Privat user only have one patient and therefor do not need an overview of patient profiles.

~Wieframes~
## 4. Prototype and Testing
## Paper Prototype
Using our Wireframes we created a first Paper Prototype to test the navigation between, arrangement of and interaction with elements on different screens.

Some feedback we got through testing was:
1. The registration process is to complex for one screen. We ended up with a 3-step registration process that changes based on if the user is an institution vs a privat user.
2. Items were originally represented by icons. Most testers agreed pictures would be more intuitive.
3. Most screens have a larger button on the button for various purpose. There sometimes would be a second one next to it, changing the buttons size and location. For the sake of continuity the button would now be in the same location on every screen and secondary buttons would be located elsewhere. 
4. Detail screens for individual items were unintuitive and incomplete. For example, a user could activate or deactivate the tag remotely only through a dropdown menu. 

## Digital Prototype
We implemented the feedback into our first clickable prototype in Figma. This prototype went into a second round of testing.
![[Pasted image 20250514151812.png]]
Some of the feedback we got:
1. The Home Screen did not feel like one. We needed to distinguish it further form other screens.
2. Most people wanted to edit the location of an item on the physical board through the item detail screen, a feature we later added.
3. While user created an account at the registration, there was no way to edit set account or log out. 
## 5. Designing the App
The next step was designing Retrace. We wanted the app to feel warm and welcoming.

# Reflection

- Deeper understanding of the concept of user requirements and resulting restrictions
- Given to a professional and mentioned during converences

Retrace was a great opportunity to use a myriad of skills we had aquired through other courses and smaller works. It was to this point the largest project of our studies in scope and time spend. Not mentioned so far were physical prototypes for both the board and tag mostly created by my teammates throughout this project. While I did partake in the ideation-phase, my focus in the latter half was the app. 

A part of this course was a final presentation of every group project. Among the many guests was Mrs. Stampfer (the representative of the "Alzheimer Gesellschaft Ingolstadt"). She was a partner of this course and asked to use the projects of this course at conferences and seminars. There, they may serve as inspiration for future projects with the purpose of supporting people with dementia.
